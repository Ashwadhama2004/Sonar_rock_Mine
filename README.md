# Rock vs. Mine Prediction Using Logistic Regression

This project uses a logistic regression model in Python to predict whether an object is a rock or a mine based on sonar data. The dataset consists of 208 examples, with 10% reserved for testing. The model achieved an accuracy of 83% on the training data and 76% on the testing data. To run the project, install the necessary libraries (`numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`) and execute the provided script. Contributions and improvements are welcome!
